A naive very incomplete Forth interpreter hacked for teaching
myself some Swift.

DISCLAIMER: I have never programmed in Forth.

XCode 6 Beta 4 used.

FEATURES
========

* read-eval-print loop.
* Forth API (Evaluator.eval()).
* Pushing integers on stack.
* Addition, subtraction and multiplication.  Implementing other arithmetic operators is left as an
  exercise to the reader.
* Defining new words.
* IF ELSE THEN.
* EMIT.
* CR.

See tests for usage.

DESIGN
======

Forth source statements are compiled into instructions for a virtual machine by
the Compiler class.  Compilation occurs when defining new words but also in
immediate mode.

The VM class interprets virtual machine code.

The Evaluator class coordinates the compiler and VM.

BACKLOG
=======

TODO: test stack level at end of tests
TODO: add support for loops
TODO: add support for more primitive Forth words
TODO: test recursivity (fibonnacci)
TODO: turn library into Framework imported by repl to learn how Swift handles public/private
